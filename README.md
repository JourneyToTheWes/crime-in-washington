# crime-in-washington

The data the group extracted is from the Data.gov website. This dataset displays the crimes committed inside the state of washington, specfically the county and the year. In this dataset, it provided over 1,000 entries, specifying the type and the number of crimes committed. The shiny app displays multiple graphs of different types of data represented. The bar graph displays the type of crimes and the amount of crimes committed for a specific individual county and year. The pie also does the same thing, but in a pie chart form. The scatter plot compares the average population to the total crimes, showing correlation, and the second scatter plot displays the number of occurance of the crime the user chose in each county. The boxplot shows the overall statistics of the different crimes being committed in a given county. The map of the state shows the highest crime committed within a certain county.
